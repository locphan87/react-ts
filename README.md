# React TypeScript

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Getting started

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:phanhoangloc/react-ts.git
$ yarn setup
$ yarn start
```

## Development flow

### Run the app

* Run the app with the default environment (staging)

```shell
$ yarn start
```

* Run the app with a specific environment

```shell
$ ENV=production yarn start
```

### Storybook

* Open the storybook to view UI components

```shell
$ yarn storybook
```

### Rebuild CSS

When you make a change to theme configuration files, it's necessary to rebuild CSS

Theme configuration files:
- `tailwind.js`
- `colors.tsx`
- `fonts.tsx`

```shell
$ yarn build:css
```

### Test the app

```shell
$ yarn test
```
